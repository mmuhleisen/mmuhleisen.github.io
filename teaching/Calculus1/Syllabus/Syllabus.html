			I am a graduate student in the mathematics department here at Penn. I arrived in the midst of the pandemic, specialized in algebraic geometry and category theory (which I will eagerly talk about to anyone interested), and now plan to graduate next year in the Spring. I also gained a great deal of experience communicating math during my time at Penn. I have been a TA for Penn’s calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math courses, I have advised Penn math majors in our department’s Directed Reading Program, I’ve been employed by a private tutoring firm where I worked with high schoolers, I volunteered through Penn as an arithmetic teacher in a New Jersey state prison, and I participate in our department’s seminars and attend conferences. I have met many students at many levels through these varied activities, I have enjoyed discussing all kinds of math with them, and now I look forward to sharing with you ideas that laid the foundation for much of modern science.

			The summer version of MATH 1400 covers in five weeks what is otherwise diluted over a full semester. We will therefore spend a day on what otherwise spans a week. Without prior exposure to differential calculus, this already rapid pace will seem especially daunting during the first three classes. While our treatment of derivatives during these classes will be self-contained and will adequately prepare us for the rest of the course, it is not a substitute for MATH 1300. In short, keeping up with the course may require some extra devotion, especially for those with little to no calculus background.

			Functions may be considered the core object of study in mathematics. From finding the zeros of linear and quadratic polynomials to establishing trig identities and log rules, functions already play a significant role in precalculus mathematics education. To understand a function at this level is to know the relationship between input and output values, allowing one to solve the quintessential precalculus problem: find 
			<math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x" display="inline"><mi>x</mi></math> if 
			<math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f(x)=0" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math> and 
			<math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><mi>f</mi></math> is some complicated function. The precalculus guiding principle is therefore to study functions individually, by how they act on numbers.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			The guiding principle in calculus is to study functions in relation to each other. For example, our first unit will be differentiation, a procedure which transforms functions into other functions. The quintessential calculus problem is correspondingly to find 
			<math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="f" display="inline"><mi>f</mi></math>, a function, if 
			<math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D(f)=0" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math> and 
			<math id="p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="D" display="inline"><mi>D</mi></math> is some procedure involving the derivative. Equations like these are called differential equations, and they are good at describing everything from the economy to elementary particles. Two techniques for solving differential equations that we’ll cover in this class are called integration and Taylor series. Along the way we’ll find many other uses for these concepts, from measuring sizes (i.e. lengths, areas, volumes) to controlling errors in approximations.

			In order to pass the course, you must receive a perfect score on the syllabus quiz, which you will take on canvas and submit before the second class. You may refer to the syllabus during the quiz and you will have unlimited attempts. The purpose of the syllabus quiz is to prove to me that you’ve read and understood all the administrative details in this syllabus. Once you’ve passed the syllabus quiz, your raw grade will be determined from the following components, and then curved upward if necessary to match grade distributions from recent summer iterations of MATH 1400.
		
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					(0%) Homework. For every topic on the syllabus, dozens if not hundreds of problems will be listed on Canvas, spread across various calculus textbooks as well as a variety of online resources. Homework will neither be collected nor graded. Please take note of the following.
				
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							You are absolutely not expected to do all the homework problems. There are deliberately far too many problems to solve in between classes, and the point is to stop when you feel confident about the material.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You are expected to find solutions to the homework problems you do work out either online, in the back of the textbook they were assigned from, or by any other means (see 
							<a class="internalLink" href="#resources" >Resources
							</a>).
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If you cannot reconcile your own solution to a problem with any solutions you look up, come talk to me about it. You will always have a chance to talk to me in between classes (see 
							<a class="internalLink" href="#office-hours" >Office Hours
							</a>).
						
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					(20%) Final Exam. There will be a traditional final exam during the last class.
				
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							The final is designed to take 1.5 hours, but you will have 2.5 hours.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The final is cumulative.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You may use any printed resource to complete the final, for instance your class notes, a “cheat sheet,” or indeed any textbook(s) of your choice.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You may not use any electronic device to complete the final unless pre-approved.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Unless you have a pre-approved arrangement, not being present at the final will result in a grade of zero. No exceptions will be made.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Collaboration on the final exam is forbidden.
						
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					(80%) Quizzes. The pace of the course demands each class begin with a quiz. Please take note of the following.
				
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							There will 
							<em>	not
							</em> be a quiz on the first day of class (or on the day of the final).
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							There 
							<em>	will
							</em> be a quiz on review day (8/7/24) emphasizing the material covered in the previous class (8/5/24).
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Each quiz is designed to take five minutes, but you will have fifteen.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Each quiz will emphasize the material covered in the previous class; at the same time, each quiz will be cumulative.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You may use any printed resource to complete quizzes, for instance your class notes, a “cheat sheet,” or indeed any textbook(s) of your choice.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You may not use any electronic device to complete quizzes unless pre-approved.
						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>

			Since homework will not be collected, you must not only solve assigned problems but also look up solutions yourself to be sure your work is correct. To that end, several textbooks list answers in an appendix or work certain problems out in an accompanying student solution manual; moreover, a great many websites contain repositories of calculus problems with solutions, and a great deal of software has been written to solve just about any calculus problem. You are encouraged 
			<em>	but not required
			</em> to use any of these resources, not just the few listed below.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			For our course, the main purpose of these resources is to serve as repositories of problems and solutions rather than as pedagogical material. While I will teach you calculus in a slightly different (and hopefully better) way than all of the resources listed below, the problems I will test you on will be just like the problems in these resources, namely, standard calculus problems. I nevertheless encourage you to seek out more and more perspectives on calculus if you find yourself stuck on a concept. Each resource explains each concept a little differently—and if you don’t find one that clicks, come talk to me and we’ll figure it out.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			You may find generative AI and calculus-specific software very useful for solving math problems, but I seriously discourage you from coming to rely on them. On the one hand, the problem with generative AI is that it may output complete nonsense—even if beautifully formatted and boldly asserted. Worse, it will drivel about even on simple calculus queries. You simply cannot (yet?) trust ChatGPT to get word problems right with any kind of consistency. On the other hand, the problem with most calculus-specific software is its limitation to evaluating expressions when the essential step in many problems is to come up with the correct expression to evaluate in the first place.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			Many but not all of the following resources are available for free. Regarding textbooks, remember you have access to the 
			<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/mpa" >MPA library
			</a> located in DRL 3N1 as well as 
			<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/" >other libraries
			</a> at Penn. 
			<em>	Any edition of a textbook will do: just email me what edition you’re using and I will add problems from that edition to future assignments.
			</em> Note also that some textbooks have ”Early Transcendental” stunt doubles. For the purposes of our course, this is an irrelevant distinction—the versions both with and without some variant of the phrase “Early Transcendental” in the title will do perfectly well. Finally, do let me know if you benefitted from a calculus resource I have not listed so I may recommend it to students in the future.

			My office is Room 4C5 in DRL, the same building where our class meets for lectures. 
		
		</p>
		<p>
			By default, you may attend my office hours. I will hold three weekly, one-hour-long, open-door meetings where you can come ask me any calculus question you have. The meetings will take place every Tuesday (in-person), Thursday (in-person), and Sunday (virtual) at times determined by questionnaire on the first day of class.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, you may request one-on-one meetings with me. Since the class size is small, I am open to scheduling up to three weekly, fifteen-minute-long, private sessions with anyone who would prefer to opt-out of office hours. This format is intended as an alternative, so I would expect you 
			<em>	not
			</em> to attend office hours. The sessions will be more helpful to you if you arrive with an agenda in mind, and if you miss two sessions without giving me prior notice, I will cancel all of our remaining meetings (but you will once again have the chance to attend office hours).

In addition, if you plan to register a disability with that office which will require any action, you should email me within 48 hours of joining the course, even if your accommodations have not yet been registered or approved. You do not need to disclose of the nature of your accommodations or disability, but knowing that you are registered makes it easier to work with SDS to get you the accommodations you need.
